# Privacy Policy for the **"Can I Drive?"** App

*Last updated: April 26, 2025*

## 1. Data Collection & Storage

### 1.1 No Personal Data Collected

We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal information (e.g., name, email, device identifiers) on our servers or third-party services. All drink entries and settings remain solely on your device.

### 1.2 Local Storage Only

All data you enter—drink times and quantities—is saved locally on your device. No data is backed up or shared externally.

## 2. Legal Compliance

### 2.1 European Union (GDPR)

- GDPR applies to “personal data,” defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable person.
- Since we collect none, most GDPR obligations (data-processing notices, legal bases, records of processing) do not apply.
- We provide this notice in a concise, transparent, and easily accessible form to ensure compliance with Articles 13–14.
- Users retain rights (access, erasure, etc.) but have no personal data to request.

### 2.2 United States (CCPA & FTC)

- Under CCPA, businesses must disclose what categories of personal information they collect and why. We collect **no** personal information, satisfying notice-at-collection obligations.
- California residents have rights to access or delete personal data—no data means no actionable requests.
- We follow FTC guidelines on mobile-app privacy: “tell the truth,” make clear disclosures, and minimize data collection.
- Although no data is collected, we use standard on-device encryption and follow best practices for app security.

## 3. User Rights & Contact

### 3.1 EU Users

Under GDPR, you have the right to request access, correction, erasure, or restriction of personal data we might hold. Since we hold none, we will confirm in writing that no data exists.

### 3.2 California Residents

Under the CCPA, you have rights to know, delete, and opt out of sale of personal data. We collect no data, so these rights cannot be exercised meaningfully.

### 3.3 General Inquiries
